<p> Aesthetic is <b>the measure or appreciation of beauty.</b> In photography, it usually means that an image appeals to the eye. there is something about its subject, composition, colour (or lack thereof). It makes you want to sit and observe it.
<br>
<br>
Aesthetic photos aim <b>to utilize visual characteristics</b> such as color, composition, lighting, and subject matter to create a visually pleasing photograph.
<br>
<br>
It is a photographic practice of capturing visual beauty within an image. Just as the term “beauty” can be subjective, “aesthetic” can be distinguished as something that is immediately visually pleasing to a viewer.
<br>
<br>
Here is a video that show <a href="https://youtu.be/0fKfM6oHpzE" target="_blanks"><i>AESTHETIC SHOOT</i></a>
<br>
<br>
 Aesthetics in photography refers to patterns in a photographer's use of visual elements to create beautiful images. These elements can be frame compositions, subjects, color schemes and lighting techniques.

For example, iconic photographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McCurry">Steve McCurry</a><br>s has developed his own unique aesthetic. McCurry’s consistent use of vibrant colors and international subject matter from his travels makes his work recognizable and beautiful.

<h2><i>The Nature and Scope of Aesthetic </i></h2>
<p>Aesthetics is broader in scope than the philosophy of art, which comprises one of its branches. It deals not only with the nature and value of the arts but also with those responses to natural objects that find expression in the language of the <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/beautiful"><i>beautiful</i></a> and ,the<i> ugly</i>. A problem is encountered at the outset, however, for terms such as <i>beautiful</i> and <i>ugly</i> seem too vague in their application and too subjective in their meaning to divide the world successfully into those things that do, and those that do not, exemplify them. Almost anything might be seen as beautiful by someone or from some point of view, and different people apply the word to quite disparate objects for reasons that often seem to have little or nothing in common. It may be that there is some single underlying belief that motivates all of their judgments. It may also be, however, that the term<i> beautiful</i> has no sense except as the expression of an attitude, which is in turn attached by different people to quite different states of affairs.
<br>

<br>
Moreover, in spite of the emphasis laid by philosophers on the terms <i>beautiful</i> and <i>ugly</i>, it is far from evident that they are the most important or the most useful either in the discussion and criticism of art or in the description of that which appeals to us in nature. To convey what is significant in a poem, we might describe it as ironic, moving, expressive, balanced, and harmonious. Likewise, in characterizing a favourite stretch of countryside, we may prefer to describe it as peaceful, soft, atmospheric, harsh, and evocative, rather than beautiful. The least that should be said is that <i>beautiful</i> belongs to a class of terms from which it has been chosen as much for convenience’ sake as for any sense that it captures what is distinctive of the class.
<br>
<br>
At the same time, there seems to be no clear way of delimiting the class in question—not at least in advance of theory. Aesthetics must therefore cast its net more widely than the study either of beauty or of other aesthetic concepts if it is to discover the principles whereby it is to be defined. We are at once returned, therefore, to the vexing question of our subject matter: What should a philosopher study in order to understand such ideas as beauty and taste?</p>
